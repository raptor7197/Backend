# Axios  :  **Axios** is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from both the browser and Node.js. It provides a simple, promise-based API for handling requests and responses, supporting features like asynchronous calls, request cancellation, and automatic JSON parsing. Axios is widely used in front-end development for fetching data from APIs and handling responses, with support for methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more. Its ease of use, ability to handle errors, and built-in features for request and response interceptors make it a go-to choice for many developers.
